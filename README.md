# AI & Data Architect Roadmap

A repository where we document, build, and evolve our shared career path into the world of AI and Data Engineering/Architecture.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- **Keep documents updated:**  
  If we update the roadmap or shared files, re-download and commit them to keep everything in sync.

---

## 🚀 Starting a New Project

1. Create a new branch named `<project>_main`
2. It's recommended to clone or pull only that branch to work locally in an organized way.
3. Create your own working branch from `<project>_main`
4. Work however you prefer, but always **merge into `<project>_main` from your own main working branch**

---

## 🔍 Pull Requests

- Open a pull request and assign your partner as **reviewer**.
- We aim for high-quality PRs and thoughtful reviews.
- **PR criteria:**
  - Keep changes scoped to a few files.
  - Make the review easy to follow and verify.

---

## 📦 Projects Structure

We recommend structuring projects like this:

- Each project focuses on one or more **tools/technologies**.
- Each **"level"** (e.g. beginner, intermediate) should have **two projects**:
  - In the second project, we **swap roles** regarding tools used in the first.
  - The second project should be **more complex**, leveraging the review process for deeper learning.

## 🧠 Semantic Commits

Use [semantic commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) when possible:

Examples:
- `feat: added transformation step with dbt`
- `fix: corrected schema validation logic`
- `docs: updated README with branching guidelines`
